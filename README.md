This work presents a Fine-grained Latent-domain Mixture-of-expert Network (FiLMN) to achieve robust object detection in dynamic weather conditions.  We dynamically allocate attention to degradation-specific features through a gating network. A theoretical error bound for domain adaptation is provided. Additionally, a focal localization loss is newly proposed to mine hard examples in extreme weather. Moreover, a two-phase training strategy is introduced to resolve learning rate conflicts between fixed backbones and adaptive experts. Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic threshold search algorithm for post-processing, which eliminates manual parameter tuning limitations. Evaluations on RTTS and ExDark benchmarks demonstrate marked improvements with gains of 3.8% mAP in dense fog and 2.0% in extremely dark environments over state-of-the-art methods. Extensive real-world validation on unmanned surface vehicles in diverse environments demonstrates FiLMNâ€™s generalization capability in the wild.
## Methods
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Newj596/FiLMN/main/imgs/methods.png)
a) We propose FiLMN, a novel architecture that dynamically partitions weather-degraded inputs into latent sub-domains and employs specialized expert modules to handle each sub-domain. A meta-gating mechanism adaptively fuses expert outputs, enabling precise feature recalibration for diverse degradation patterns. The domain adaptation error bound of FiLMN is theoretically given. In addition, a focal distillation loss is formulated to handle hard examples in dynamic weather conditions.

b) To resolve learning rate conflicts between pre-trained backbones and domain-specific components, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm, called C2F for short. In the coarse stage, domain-aware modules (experts and gating networks) are trained at high learning rates to rapidly capture degradation-specific features. In the fine stage, the full network is learned at a reduced learning rate, ensuring stable convergence while preserving global contextual coherence. 

c) We propose a multi-iterative optimization method called DTS on the basis of the golden section selection mechanism. It replaces empirically predefined thresholds through a multi-stage iterative optimization framework to search the best confidence threshold for post-processing. This approach dynamically adapts to varying degradation patterns in adverse weather conditions, enhancing detection performance without manual parameter tuning and additional task-special subnet design required by existing methods.
